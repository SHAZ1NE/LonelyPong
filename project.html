      <h3>Shameer Syed Alam</h3>
      <p>I began coding in Year 7 where I taught myself Python. I went on to improve my skills throughout the years,
         I also learnt a small amount of C# as I used Unity at A-Level for my NEA project.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Lonely Pong</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of classes and interaction between them. I created a "single-player pong". The paddle is
    controlled with the w and s keys to move up and down. The ball starts in the middle of the screen and
    moves left always but it can go up or down using random(). The player will then rebound it against the wall
    until they miss. Every time they hit the ball against the paddle their score increases by 1.
